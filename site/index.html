<p>Raw bananas are small to medium in size and are elongated, cylindrical, and slightly curved in shape.<br />
    The peels are thick, smooth, and green with a fibrous texture and semi-bitter flavor, and the surface can easily be scratched and marked.
    <br />The white to cream-colored flesh is dense, firm, and creamy with central tiny, infertile seeds or is seedless, and the flesh runs the entire length of the peel

 <!-- <h3>Shallots vs. Onions</h3>
 <p>   If you shallots in the pantry but your recipe calls for onion, you can substitute each of those.<br /> This switch will come in handy if you are cutting a recipe in half and don't want to use only part of an onion.<br />
     The general rule of thumb is for every small onion, use three small shallots. Just remember the taste will be milder and less "oniony."
